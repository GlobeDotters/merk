  <b><big>Open Source IRC Client</big></b><br>

**MERK** is a graphical [open source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) [Internet relay chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client. The current development version is **0.032.064**. It uses a [multiple-document interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-document_interface), much like the popular Windows IRC client [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/).  **MERK** is written in Python 3, using the [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) libraries, and runs on both Windows and Linux. **MERK** is updated frequently with new features and bugfixes.

**MERK** is still in development, but it works, and can be used for most IRC activities.

Join me on the official **MERK** IRC channel, **#merk** on the Libera Chat network! Connect to  Libera in the client as one of the built-in server suggestions, or at **irc.libera.chat**, port **6667** (you can also connect via SSL on port **6697**). Honestly, I work a lot, so I'm almost always idle, but I pop in and chat a few times a day!

# Requirements

**MERK** requires Python 3, [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/). PyQt5 and Twisted can be installed by using [**pip**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install pyqt5
    pip install Twisted

To connect to IRC servers via SSL, two additional libraries may be needed:

    pip install pyOpenSSL
    pip install service_identity

**MERK** is being developed with Python 3.13 on Windows 11 and Linux Mint.

If you're running Windows, and you're getting errors when trying to run **MERK**, you may have to install another library, [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/). You can also install this with [**pip**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install pywin32

To run properly on Linux, the latest version of all required software is recommended.

There are three libraries that comes bundled with **MERK**:
 - [qt5reactor](https://github.com/twisted/qt5reactor)
 - [pyspellchecker](https://github.com/barrust/pyspellchecker)
 - [emoji](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji)

# Running MERK

First, make sure that all the requirements are installed. Next, [download **MERK**](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/merk/raw/main/downloads/merk-latest.zip). Extract the zipfile to a directory of your choice using your favorite archive/zip program. Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you extracted **MERK** to, and type:

    python merk.py

# Why does MERK exist?
It's simple. I don't currently like any of the other IRC clients. I've used many, _many_ other IRC clients for Windows and Linux, and they just didn't feel _right_. They weren't customizable enough, didn't have features that I wanted, or just plain looked ancient. I wanted a GUI IRC client that looked and felt modern, and could be heavily customized. My previous IRC client was called [**∆èrk**](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/erk), and although I liked developing it and working on it, I honestly didn't use it that much. I fell out of love with the "single window" interface that so many other IRC clients use, and decided to try something "new" (and by "new" I mean 30 years old). I remembered using [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/) back when I was younger, and decided to try and write a new client that used the [multiple-document interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-document_interface) style I remember fondly. And thus, __MERK__ was born!

# What does MERK mean?
Well, if you were to pronounce "IRC" as a word and not an acronym, it would probably be pronounced _/∆èrk/_. Since the client allows a user to connect to multiple IRC servers at the same time, well, that might be what the "M" stands for. Either that, or "multiple-document interface". "MDIIRC" doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, so we combined the "M" with the word-pronunciation of IRC, and came up with __MERK__!

# Developing MERK

Several tools are included in [the official **MERK** repository](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/merk) for developing **MERK**. The [`pyrcc5` utility](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/pyrcc5.1.html) is required, and should be installed automatically when you install PyQt. These are only needed if you're developing **MERK**, and can be ignored if you're only using the **MERK** IRC client.

 - ***compile_resources.bat*** - This batch file compiles the miscellaneous resources (graphics, fonts, etc) required by **MERK** into a single file, `resources.py`, and inserts the file into the **MERK** source code. This is for development on the Windows platform.
 - ***compile_resources.sh*** - This shell script basically does the same thing that `compile_resources.bat` does, only it's for development on the Linux platform.
 - ***build_readme.py*** - This is a Python 3 script that rebuilds the README:
   - Reads`README.txt` into memory and replaces several symbols in it:
     - `! _VERSION_ !` (without spaces) is replaced with **MERK**'s major version
     - `! _MINOR_ !` (without spaces) is replaced with **MERK**'s minor version
     - `! _FULL_VERSION_ !` (without spaces) is replaced with **MERK**'s major and minor version, with a period in between them.
   - Overwrites `README.md` with the edited contents of `README.txt`
 - ***build_dist.py*** - This is a Python 3 script that, when executed, does several things:
   - Executes either `compile_resources.bat` (if the host system is Windows) or `compile_resources.sh` (if the host system is Linux); if the host system is not running either Windows or Linux, `build_dist.py` will exit with an error
   - Increments the **MERK**'s minor version (which is stored in `merk/data/minor.txt`) and saves it
   - Reads`README.txt` into memory and replaces several symbols in it:
     - `! _VERSION_ !` (without spaces) is replaced with **MERK**'s major version
     - `! _MINOR_ !` (without spaces) is replaced with **MERK**'s minor version
     - `! _FULL_VERSION_ !` (without spaces) is replaced with **MERK**'s major and minor version, with a period in between them.
   - Overwrites `README.md` with the edited contents of `README.txt`
   - Creates a new directory named `dist`, and copies into it:
     - `merk.py`
     - `LICENSE`
     - `merk.ico`
     - The `merk` directory and its contents
     - The `qt5reactor` directory and its contents
     - The `spellchecker` directory and its contents
     - The `emoji` directory and its contents
     
   - Zips up the `dist` directory either using [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) (if the host system is Windows) or the [zip](https://linux.die.net/man/1/zip) utility (if the host system is Linux) into a file named `dist.zip`
   - Deletes the `dist` directory and its contents
   - Renames `dist.zip` to "merk-*MAJOR VERSION*.zip", referred to as `merk.zip` in this description.
   - If `merk.zip` exists in the `downloads` directory, the version in the `downloads` directory is deleted
   - If `merk-latest.zip` exists in the `downloads` directory, it is deleted
   - `merk.zip` is copied into the `downloads` directory, and is copied to `merk-latest.zip`
