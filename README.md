**MERK** is a graphical [open source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) [Internet relay chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client. The current development version is **0.024.071**. It uses a [multiple-document interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-document_interface), much like the popular Windows IRC client [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/).  **MERK** is written in Python 3, using the [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) libraries, and runs on both Windows and Linux.

**MERK** is in beta, but it works, and can be used for most IRC activities.

# Requirements

**MERK** requires Python 3, [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/). PyQt5 and Twisted can be installed by using [**pip**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install pyqt5
    pip install Twisted

To connect to IRC servers via SSL, two additional libraries may be needed:

    pip install pyOpenSSL
    pip install service_identity

**MERK** is being developed with Python 3.13 on Windows 11 and Linux Mint.

If you're running Windows, and you're getting errors when trying to run **MERK**, you may have to install another library, [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/). You can also install this with [**pip**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install pywin32

To run properly on Linux, the latest version of all required software is recommended.

There are three libraries that comes bundled with **MERK**:
 - [qt5reactor](https://github.com/twisted/qt5reactor)
 - [pyspellchecker](https://github.com/barrust/pyspellchecker)
 - [emoji](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji)

# Running MERK

First, make sure that all the requirements are installed. Next, [download **MERK**](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/merk/raw/main/downloads/merk-latest.zip). Extract the zipfile to a directory of your choice using your favorite archive/zip program. Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you extracted **MERK** to, and type:

    python merk.py

# Developing MERK

Several tools are included in [the official **MERK** repository](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/merk) for developing **MERK**. The [`pyrcc5` utility](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/pyrcc5.1.html) is required, and should be installed automatically when you install PyQt. These are only needed if you're developing **MERK**, and can be ignored if you're only using the **MERK** IRC client.

 - ***compile_resources.bat*** - This batch file compiles the miscellaneous resources (graphics, fonts, etc) required by **MERK** into a single file, `resources.py`, and inserts the file into the **MERK** source code. This is for development on the Windows platform.
 - ***compile_resources.sh*** - This shell script basically does the same thing that `compile_resources.bat` does, only it's for development on the Linux platform.
 - ***build_dist.py*** - This is a Python 3 script that, when executed, does several things:
   - Executes either `compile_resources.bat` (if the host system is Windows) or `compile_resources.sh` (if the host system is Linux); if the host system is not running either Windows or Linux, `build_dist.py` will exit with an error
   - Increments the **MERK**'s minor version (which is stored in `merk/data/minor.txt`) and saves it
   - Reads`README.txt` into memory and replaces several symbols in it:
     - `! _VERSION_ !` (without spaces) is replaced with **MERK**'s major version
     - `! _MINOR_ !` (without spaces) is replaced with **MERK**'s minor version
     - `! _FULL_VERSION_ !` (without spaces) is replaced with **MERK**'s major and minor version, with a period in between them.
   - Overwrites `README.md` with the edited contents of `README.txt`
   - Creates a new directory named `dist`, and copies into it:
     - `merk.py`
     - `LICENSE`
     - `README.md`
     - The `merk` directory and its contents
     - The `qt5reactor` directory and its contents
     - The `spellchecker` directory and its contents
     - The `emoji` directory and its contents
     
   - Zips up the `dist` directory either using [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) (if the host system is Windows) or the [zip](https://linux.die.net/man/1/zip) utility (if the host system is Linux) into a file named `dist.zip`
   - Deletes the `dist` directory and its contents
   - Renames `dist.zip` to "merk-*MAJOR VERSION*.zip", referred to as `merk.zip` in this description.
   - If `merk.zip` exists in the `downloads` directory, the version in the `downloads` directory is deleted
   - If `merk-latest.zip` exists in the `downloads` directory, it is deleted
   - `merk.zip` is copied into the `downloads` directory, and is copied to `merk-latest.zip`
